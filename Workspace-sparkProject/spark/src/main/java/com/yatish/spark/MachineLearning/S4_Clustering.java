	 * What is Clustering?
	 * clustering means classification. In simple terms, consider we have a lot of fruits, when a customer asks for apple, we have to search in the complete lot, consider if we classify/cluster them
	 * like we separate each type of fruit into groups and keep it in crates, then if use asks for apple, we just go to the apple crate and give him which is much more easier. This process of 
	 * separating each type of fruit into groups is called as clustering.
