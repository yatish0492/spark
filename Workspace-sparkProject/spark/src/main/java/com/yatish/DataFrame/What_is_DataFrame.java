	 * What is DataFrame?
	 * A DataFrame is a Dataset organized into named columns.It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database. but with richer optimizations under the hood.
	 * 
	 * How can we create an DataFrame?
	 * DataFrame can be created from any source like from RDD, HIVE, files etc.
	 * 
	 * Why am i not able to declare a variable as 'DataFrame abc', it is not able to resolve 'DataFrame' type?
	 * Spark has added a new type 'DataFrame' in python and R but for java and scala, it has not added explicit 'DataFrame' type. We need to give the type as 'Dataset<Row>' to represent a 'DataFrame'
	 * Basically, 'DataFrame' is nothing but the 'data set of rows'.
